# Favoriten.nu
Favoriten.nu is a project I developed with Jens Rathsman and Oscar Rundqvist to help resturants in Stockholm during the initial period crisis surrounding 
the spread of covid-19. The idea was very simple, if we can get people to buy vouchers for resturants then they can survive through the crisis. 

We roughly three thousand unique visitors on the site over the period of a couple of weeks before shutting it down due people beeing able to visit resturants in Sweden. 

## Technical
The project is built using Next.js, typescript, mongoDb, sass and Google-apis. 
To utilize the full program you have to input your own Google API-keys in next.config.js

Due to utilizing next.js API Routes the easiest way to host the code is through vercel.com
